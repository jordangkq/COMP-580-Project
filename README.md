## COMP-580-Project ##

# Who is it for?
Visually impaired kids (primarily geared towards pre-K math skills but can be fun for all ages!) 

# What is it? How will it work? 
It is a math game using beats! We have done some research about how music can be used to teach basic math skills like one-to-one correspondence, counting, making comparisons, and concepts such as more than, less than, equal, and same as. 
There will be four beat tiles that make various noises. It will have 2 modes: Pattern Recognition and Making Comparisons. The kids will pick a mode, then learn the sounds that each tile makes in that mode, hear a description of the game, do a practice run, and then play! They will earn a ton of points for everything.
