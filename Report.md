## Description of project
It is a math game using music! We have done some research about how music can be used to teach basic math skills like one-to-one correspondence, counting, making comparisons, and concepts such as more than, less than, equal, and same as. The game has 2 modes: Pattern Recognition and Making Comparisons. In both modes, there are four “beat tiles” that make various musical notes. To play, pick a mode, then learn the sounds that each tile makes in that mode, hear a description of the game, do a practice run, and then play!

## Intended audience
Individuals with visual, cognitive, and motor impairments

## Technologies
- Browser-based Voice and Sound API's
- DOM

## Frameworks
- None

## Libraries Used
- Javascript
- CSS
- JQuery

## How to build and deploy it
Click on the link and play in Google Chrome browser!

## Problems encountered 
- Given the severe interruption caused by COVID-19, we had to decrease the number of modes we intended to build down to 2 essential modes.
- Working with the built-in browser speech proved difficult given the timing of the speech and musical tones and restrictions on when the browser allows speech (only after the user has interacted with the page).

## Future work
- Building more modes that expand the utility and entertainment of the game
- Tablet and mobile phone browser support
- Haptic feedback when switching between buttons on a mobile device such as tablet to help blind individuals know where they are in the game space
